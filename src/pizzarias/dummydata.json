        "description": "Kirill (Nikita Volkov) gets back after a work festivity to discover another person living in his loft. Before long he tracks down that nobody recalls that him-Not even the public authority! He finds he has been decided to be an import/export officer, an individual who can open ways to different universes.\r\n\r\nThis film feels like a work in progress. There was so much addressed and packed into this film. It would have done well to extend a few pieces of the storyline. The sentiment among Kirill and Anna had no profundity or goal. Despite the fact that there were a couple of contacting minutes they weren’t adequately long to allow you to mind.",
